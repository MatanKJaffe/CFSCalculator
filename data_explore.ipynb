    "# Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) Calculation Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a rule-based engine in Python to automatically calculate the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) for patients based on data from two main sources: `Cleaned_Assessment.csv` and `Diagnosis.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses a decoupled architecture where the logic is separated from the data processing engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cfs_rule_engine.py`**: This is the core script that contains the rule engine logic. It loads patient data, gathers \"facts\" about each patient, evaluates these facts against a set of rules, and writes the results to a CSV file.\n",
    "- **`cfs_rules.json`**: This file defines the clinical logic for assigning a CFS score. It contains a list of rules, each with a priority, a set of conditions, and a resulting CFS score and description. The engine processes rules in order of priority.\n",
    "- **`cfs_fact.json`**: This file serves as a data dictionary, mapping the raw data from the source CSVs (which includes Hebrew strings) into a standardized set of English \"facts\" that the rule engine can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Data**: The script loads the assessment and diagnosis data from the CSV files.\n",
    "2. **Load Definitions**: The rules from `cfs_rules.json` and fact mappings from `cfs_fact.json` are loaded.\n",
    "3. **Process Patients**: For each unique patient, the script performs the following:\n",
    "    a. **Fact Gathering**: The `get_patient_facts` function gathers all available information for a patient and translates it into a standardized `facts` dictionary using the mappings in `cfs_fact.json`. This includes a special tiered logic to infer a patient's health status if it's not explicitly stated.\n",
    "    b. **Rule Evaluation**: The `evaluate_rules` function takes the patient's `facts` and checks them against the list of rules, starting with the highest priority (lowest number).\n",
    "    c. **Assign Score**: The first rule that matches the patient's facts determines their CFS score.\n",
    "4. **Save Results**: The final CFS scores, along with all the facts used for the calculation, are saved to `CFS_Results.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the calculation, execute the following command in a terminal with the appropriate Python environment activated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python cfs_rule_engine.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive way to explore the data and the results. Let's start by loading the data."
